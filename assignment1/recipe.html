    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="imagecen" ><img src="./cinnamon-1.jpeg" alt="Cinnamon Roll 4 " /> </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Crescent roll dough – you can use canned crescent roll dough or sheets of canned crescent dough. Sheets of dough are easier to work with as you don't need to press the perforations together.</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter – make sure it's softened by removing it from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before starting.</li>
        <li>Pazazz apples – sweet, tart, and crispy apples. Click <a href="https://www.example.com">here</a> to find out where you can buy these apples in your area!</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the crescent roll dough. Place a large piece of parchment paper on a flat work surface. Place both sheets of crescent roll dough slightly overlapping on the parchment paper and press the seams together to form one large crescent roll rectangle.</li>
        <li>Top with the cinnamon sugar butter. In a medium bowl, combine softened butter with granulated sugar, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly across the crescent roll dough.</li>
        <li>Add the apples. Core and thinly slice one Pazazz apple, then place the slices on top of the cinnamon sugar butter in an even layer, avoiding overlap.</li>
        <li>Roll it up. Roll the crescent roll dough tightly over the apples and the cinnamon sugar butter into a tube.</li>
        <li>Slice it in half. Use a sharp knife to slice lengthwise through the middle of the cinnamon roll tube.</li>
        <li>Separate the two halves. Once sliced, separate the two halves, ensuring the cinnamon butter and apples are facing up on both halves.</li>
        <li>Braid them together. Carefully braid the two halves together, lifting one half over the other until it forms a long braid.</li>
        <li>Form the wreath. Bring the two ends of the braid together to form a wreath, then transfer the wreath on the parchment paper to a baking sheet. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
